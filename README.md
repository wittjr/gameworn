Django web site to display sports memorabilia collections. Still in progress but key features aim to be:
* Display your collection (community tends to use sites like smugmug and flikr currently)
* Browse other collections
* Search for players/teams/etc from other collections
* Allow owners to mark items as for sale/trade
* Let users create a want list
* Try to assist in maintaining provinence of items (users can mark items as transferred to others)
* Getty images integration to help photomatch items (might be too pricey)


Inspiration from collections I've seen:
