[HOOK DEGRADATION]
jq is not installed — the following guardrails are degraded for this session:
- Secret detection & file-lock coordination (pre-tool-use-validator.sh): skipped entirely
- Dangerous-command warnings (dangerous-command-guard.sh): skipped entirely
- Commit quality gate (pre-commit-verification.sh): skipped entirely — commits are not gate-blocked
- Task-completion quality gate (task-quality-gate.sh): skipped entirely
Unaffected: pre-push-main-blocker.sh's branch-block does not depend on jq and
keeps working either way; permissions.deny (.claude/settings.json) is
enforced at the permission layer regardless of jq or any hook.
Install jq to restore full hook coverage.
