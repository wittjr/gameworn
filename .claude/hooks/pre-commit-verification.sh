# Hook: pre-commit-verification
# Event: PreToolUse (Bash)
# Purpose: Run the project's detected quality gates before git commits and
# block the commit on failure.
#
# Enforcement rewrite (artifacts/plan_framework_hardening.md, unit U5b): this
# hook used to only ever print advisory text and trust a time-only stamp the
# AGENT was instructed to write by hand — self-attestation, not verification
# (see the plan's Design Principles). It now runs the gates itself. A stamp
# is trusted only when BOTH fresh (<=5 min) AND content-bound: its recorded
# tree-hash must equal the current `git write-tree` output, so a change
# staged seconds ago forces a re-run even if the last stamp is a minute old
# (review F8 — a time-only stamp rides post-edit changes). The stamp file is
# hook-authored only; nothing in this file's own output ever instructs the
# agent to write it.

# jq is required to parse tool input; fail open if unavailable (hooks are

[PRE-COMMIT VERIFICATION REQUIRED]

Before committing, you MUST complete these steps:

1. RUN ALL TESTS AND LINTING:
   - Run the project's test suite and ensure all tests pass
   - Run linting/formatting checks and fix any issues
   - Run type checking if available

   Detected tools in this project: none detected - check manually

2. FIX ALL FAILURES:
   - If tests fail, fix the code until they pass
   - If linting fails, fix the issues
   - Do NOT skip or disable failing checks

3. CRITICAL: NEVER REMOVE OR SKIP TESTS
   - Do NOT delete test files or test cases to make tests pass
   - Do NOT comment out failing tests
   - Do NOT add skip decorators to avoid failures
   - Fix the actual code issues instead

4. AFTER VERIFICATION SUCCEEDS:
   - Proceed with the git commit. No gates were detected for this project,
     so this manual pass is the only verification that happens — nothing
     here is written or re-checked automatically.

If you cannot fix a test legitimately, STOP and ask the user for guidance.
