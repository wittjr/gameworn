1. **Why?** [First level cause]
2. **Why?** [Second level cause]
3. **Why?** [Third level cause]
4. **Why?** [Fourth level cause]
5. **Why?** [Root cause]

### Trigger

## Contributing Factors

Factors that made the incident possible or worse:

- [ ] **Detection Gap**: [Monitoring didn't catch it]
- [ ] **Process Gap**: [Missing runbook/procedure]
- [ ] **Testing Gap**: [Untested scenario]
- [ ] **Documentation Gap**: [Missing/outdated docs]
- [ ] **Capacity Issue**: [Resource constraints]
- [ ] **Dependency Failure**: [External service]
- [ ] **Configuration Error**: [Misconfiguration]
- [ ] **Code Defect**: [Bug in code]
- [ ] **Human Error**: [Manual mistake]

## Detection

### How Was It Detected?

- [ ] Automated monitoring/alerting
- [ ] Customer report
- [ ] Internal user report
- [ ] Scheduled check
- [ ] Other: [specify]

### Detection Delay

<!--
Key Incident Metrics:
- TTD: When did we first know something was wrong?
- TTA: When did someone acknowledge and start investigating?
- TTM: When was the bleeding stopped (even if not fully fixed)?
- TTR: When was the incident fully resolved?
- MTTR (Mean Time to Recovery) = TTR, used for aggregate reporting
-->

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Time to Detection (TTD) | [X minutes] | First alert or report |
| Time to Acknowledgment (TTA) | [X minutes] | Investigation started |
| Time to Mitigation (TTM) | [X minutes] | Bleeding stopped |
| Time to Resolution (TTR/MTTR) | [X minutes] | Fully resolved |

### Detection Gaps

[What should have alerted us but didn't?]

---

## Response

### What Went Well

- [Positive 1: e.g., "Quick escalation to on-call"]
- [Positive 2: e.g., "Clear communication in incident channel"]
- [Positive 3: e.g., "Runbook was helpful"]

### What Didn't Go Well

- [Issue 1: e.g., "Took too long to identify root cause"]
- [Issue 2: e.g., "Missing access to logs"]
- [Issue 3: e.g., "Unclear ownership"]

### Where We Got Lucky

- [Lucky break 1: e.g., "Engineer happened to be online"]
- [Lucky break 2: e.g., "Impact was during low-traffic period"]
