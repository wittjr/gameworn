# Go Golden Path

This project's daily loop runs on the standard go tool and golangci-lint — golden-path choices recorded in `.claude/rules/tech-strategy.md`, not decided here.

## The Daily Loop

- While editing: keep `go vet` and `golangci-lint run` in a tight loop — run them after every meaningful change, not just before a commit.
- Before every commit: `go test ./...`.
- Before shipping: `go build ./...` — a passing test suite doesn't guarantee a passing build.

## The Four Commands

| Command | Gate |
|---------|------|
| `go test ./...` | Test suite |
| `go vet ./...` | Static analysis |
| `golangci-lint run` | Lint |
| `go build ./...` | Build |

## Module Discipline

Regenerate `go.sum` with `go mod tidy` after every dependency change — never hand-edit it. Commit `go.mod` and `go.sum` together in the same commit, every time.

## Gates Wiring

`.claude/hooks/pre-commit-verification.sh` auto-detects this stack from `go.mod` and reminds you to run these commands before a commit lands. CI runs the same gates plus a dependency-audit step (`govulncheck ./...`) that has no local pre-commit equivalent — see this pack's `ci-gates.yml`.

## Related Skills

Not this skill's job: `dependency-upgrade` (bumping a package), `land-the-plane` (shipping the finished work), `review-steering` (configuring automated code review).
