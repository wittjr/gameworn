# Security Audit: [Scope/Component]

<!--
Security Audit Report
Filename: artifacts/security_audit_[date].md
Owner: Security / Engineering
Handoff to: Engineering for remediation, Architecture review for design changes
Related Skills: threat-modeling

Methodology:
- STRIDE threat modeling (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, DoS, Elevation)
- OWASP Top 10 (2021) - https://owasp.org/Top10/
- MITRE ATT&CK framework for advanced threat mapping - https://attack.mitre.org/
- CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) for vulnerability classification
- Dependency scanning (Trivy, Snyk, or equivalent)

For cloud-native systems, also consider:
- Shared responsibility model (what's provider-managed vs customer-managed)
- IAM policies, roles, and service accounts
- Network segmentation (VPCs, security groups)
- Managed service configurations
-->
